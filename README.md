# LibraryMCP

LibraryMCP is a FastAPI-based backend server designed to serve as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool invocation source for library management. It provides a set of API endpoints to manage books, members, and loans in a library system.

## Features

- **Books Management**: Full CRUD with filtering by title, author, genre, and availability.
- **Members Management**: Register, list (with filters), view details with loan history and fines, update, and delete with business rules.
- **Loans Management**: Borrow/return workflows, active loans listing, and fine calculations.
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight storage using SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **CORS Enabled**: Open CORS for easy local development and browser demos.
- **Simple Frontend Demo**: Minimal HTML page to add/list books and members.
- **Seeding Tool**: Built-in script to populate the database with initial sample data.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.13
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended for dependency management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd libraryMCP
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

Start the FastAPI server using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)
- **OpenAPI JSON**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json](http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json) (a snapshot also lives at `openapi.json`)

### Seeding the Database

To populate the database with sample data, run the seed script:

```bash
uv run python backend/seed.py
```

### Simple Frontend Demo (optional)

You can interact with the API using a tiny frontend:

- Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
- Ensure the backend runs at `http://localhost:8000` (CORS is enabled)
- Use the UI to add/list books and members

## API Endpoints Overview

### Books
- `GET /books/` — List books with optional filters.
  - Query: `title`, `author`, `genre`, `available_only`
- `GET /books/{id}` — Get a single book by ID.
- `POST /books/` — Create a book (initial `available_copies = total_copies`).
- `PUT /books/{id}` — Update a book.
- `DELETE /books/{id}` — Delete a book (blocked if there are active loans).

### Members
- `GET /members/` — List members with filters and pagination.
  - Query: `skip`, `limit`, `name`, `email`, `is_active`
- `GET /members/{id}` — Get member details with loan history, active loans count, and total fines.
- `POST /members/` — Register a new member (unique email required).
- `PUT /members/{id}` — Update member (cannot deactivate with active loans; email must be unique/valid).
- `DELETE /members/{id}` — Delete member (blocked if active loans or unpaid fines).

### Loans
- `POST /loans/borrow` — Borrow a book (member must be active; book must have available copies; no duplicate active loan).
- `POST /loans/return` — Return a book (increments availability; computes fine if overdue: $0.50/day).
- `GET /loans/{member_id}` — List active loans for a member.
- `GET /loans/{member_id}/fines` — Calculate and return fine breakdown for a member.
